Tools integration lets you interact with a variety of tools naturally through chat - asking your assistant to book meetings, query databases, fetch news, and more. It transforms your AI from a code helper into a powerful automation companion.

## Understanding Tools Integration

Tools Integration creates a bridge between your AI assistant and external services:

> "Instead of switching between apps, tell your AI assistant what you needâ€”it handles the rest using your connected tools."

This feature turns conversational requests into real actions. When you connect a tool like Cal.com, you can simply tell your assistant "List my bookings on cal.com" and it will list your bookings through the integration. No need to leave your development environment or manually interact with external platforms.
