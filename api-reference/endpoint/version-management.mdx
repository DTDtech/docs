title: "Version History"
---

Manage and track changes to your application throughout development with comprehensive version control.

## Understanding Version History

Your version history provides a complete timeline of your application's development, with each entry representing a specific state of your code at a particular point in time. Every commit creates a new version that you can preview, test, and deploy.

The version history interface displays:

- **Commit messages** describing what changed
- **Commit hashes** for unique identification
- **Timestamps** showing when changes were made
- **Environment tags** indicating deployment status (Development, Production, Preview)

## Creating Preview Deployments

Preview deployments let you test any version of your application in an isolated environment before promoting changes to production.

To create a preview:

1. Navigate to any version in your history
2. Click the **Create Preview** button
3. Wait for the preview environment to build and deploy

Each preview deployment runs independently with its own:

- Application instance
- Database copy
- Environment variables and secrets
- Accessible URL for testing

## Interacting with Preview Deployments

Once a preview is created, click **View Preview Deployment** to access a comprehensive management interface with three key areas:

### Database Tab

Inspect and explore the preview environment's database:

- View table structures and data
- Browse records without affecting production
- Verify data migrations and schema changes
- Export data for analysis

### Secret Management Tab

Configure environment-specific secrets and variables:

- Add new secrets using the name/value form
- View all saved secrets for the preview environment
- Update existing secret values
- Test integrations with third-party services using preview-specific API keys

### SQL Editor Tab

Execute queries directly against the preview database:

- Run SELECT queries to inspect data
- Test complex queries before production deployment
- Debug database-related issues
- Validate data transformations and migrations

## Deploying to Production

When you're satisfied with a preview deployment, promote it to production with confidence:

1. Click **Deploy to Production** from the preview deployment dialog
2. The system will automatically:
   - Analyze differences between preview and production databases
   - Generate migration statements for any schema changes
   - Present the migration SQL for your review
3. Review the migration statements:
   - Inspect each generated SQL statement
   - Edit migrations if adjustments are needed
   - Add custom migration logic if required
   - Confirm the migrations are safe to execute
4. Upon confirmation, the system will:
   - Execute the approved migrations on the production database
   - Deploy the exact code from that version
   - Update production secrets and environment variables
   - Create a production deployment record

The production deployment maintains full traceability, showing which preview was promoted, what migrations were applied, and when the deployment occurred.
