title: "Assigning a Domain"
---

Assigning a custom domain to your application allows users to access it through a clean, branded web address instead of a system-generated one. The setup involves configuring your DNS records and linking them to your deployed app.

## Understanding Domain Assignment

When you assign a domain, you’re essentially telling the internet:

> “When someone types `app.mydomain.com`, send them to my application.”

To achieve this, you’ll configure **DNS records** (instructions that connect your domain name to your app). Don’t worry if this sounds technical—we’ll guide you step by step.

The process involves **three steps**:

1. **DNS Setup** – Configure your DNS provider to point your domain to our system
2. **Assign Frontend Domain** – Choose the subdomain for your application (e.g., `app.mydomain.com`)
3. **Assign Authentication Domain** – Confirm the dedicated authentication subdomain (`auth.mydomain.com`)

## Step 1: DNS Setup

Before assigning the domain, you’ll need to add **CNAME records** to your domain registrar (where you purchased your domain, such as GoDaddy, Cloudflare, or Namecheap).

You will need to create **two records**:

- **Frontend Subdomain** (e.g., `app.mydomain.com`) → Points users to your application
- **Authentication Subdomain** (`auth.mydomain.com`) → Reserved for secure login and authentication

> Think of CNAME records like forwarding instructions: they tell browsers where to find your app when someone types in your domain.

After creating these records, DNS changes may take a few minutes to propagate.

## Step 2: Assign Domain

Once DNS is set up, return to the app builder and enter your **subdomain** (for example: `dev.mydomain.com` or `app.mydomain.com`).

- The system will automatically validate whether the DNS record is correctly configured.
- Use the **Refresh Status** button to check progress if it shows as "Initializing."

⚠️ Note: The `auth` subdomain is reserved for authentication and cannot be used as your domain.

## Step 3: Assign Authentication Domain

For authentication, the system automatically reserves a dedicated subdomain:

- `auth.mydomain.com`

You don’t need to choose this—it’s fixed and required to keep authentication traffic separate from your main app.

- Just confirm this step and click **Assign Backend Domain**.
- Again, you can use **Refresh Status** to check if the DNS configuration has been recognized.

## Finalizing Domain Assignment

Once both frontend and authentication subdomains are assigned, your application will be accessible using your chosen domain.

- **Frontend domain**: Where users visit your app
- **Authentication domain**: Where login, signup, and authentication happen securely

This separation ensures better security and reliability for your application.
