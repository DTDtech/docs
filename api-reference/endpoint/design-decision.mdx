### Environment interaction

Version history will allow users to interact with secrets, databases, and sql editors in the preview/production environments.

Development environment will not be accessible through version history, because the main layout of the app, which contains database, secret, and ai chat, will serve the development environment.

### User management

There will be only one user management across environments. This is because we inject workos environment variables in production environment to all deployments, so registration block works uniformly in preview/production.
