You can create an account and get started for free. On any tier, you can create infinite apps, but have a limit on the size of your apps and how many you can publish.

## Understanding Credits and Limits

Your plan includes different types of credits and limits that refresh monthly:

### AI Messages

Every message you send to the AI assistant counts as one message credit. Free users have both daily (7) and monthly (25) limits, while paid plans only have monthly limits for more flexibility.

### Database Credits

Each new database you create uses one database credit. This allows you to experiment with different database structures and configurations.

### File Credits

Every file you upload to the platform (images, documents, data files) consumes one file credit. Files remain accessible after upload.

### Tool Integration Credits

When you use connected tools (like Cal.com for booking meetings or PostgreSQL for queries), each action uses one tool integration credit. Simply chatting about tools doesn't consume credits—only actual tool actions do.

### Database Preview Limit

This is the maximum number of databases you can have active in development at the same time. It's not a credit system but a concurrent limit. Delete old test databases to free up space for new ones.
